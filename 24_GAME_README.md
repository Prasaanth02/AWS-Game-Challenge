# 24 Game - Mathematical Puzzle Challenge

A sophisticated terminal-based mathematical puzzle game where players must use four random numbers (1-9) with basic arithmetic operations to create expressions that equal exactly 24. Perfect for developing logical thinking, mental arithmetic, and problem-solving skills!

## üéØ Game Overview

The 24 Game is a classic mathematical puzzle that challenges players to use all four given numbers exactly once, combining them with arithmetic operations (+, ‚àí, √ó, √∑) and parentheses to reach the target number 24. This implementation features multiple difficulty levels, intelligent hint systems, and comprehensive solution validation.

## üéÆ How to Play

### Objective
Create a mathematical expression using all four given numbers exactly once to equal 24.

### Basic Rules
- **Use all four numbers**: Each number must be used exactly once
- **Arithmetic operations**: Combine numbers with +, ‚àí, √ó, √∑
- **Parentheses allowed**: Control order of operations with parentheses
- **Target**: The result must equal exactly 24
- **Whole numbers only**: Division must result in whole numbers (no decimals)

### Example Solutions
```
Numbers: [3, 3, 8, 8]  ‚Üí  (8 √∑ 8 + 3) √ó 3 = 24
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4]  ‚Üí  (1 + 2 + 3) √ó 4 = 24
Numbers: [4, 1, 8, 7]  ‚Üí  (8 ‚àí 4) √ó (7 ‚àí 1) = 24
Numbers: [2, 2, 6, 6]  ‚Üí  (6 + 6) √ó (2 + 2) = 24
```
